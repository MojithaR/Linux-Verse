## Installing, Updating, and Removing Packages ðŸ”„

- **Installing Packages**: Use package manager commands to install software and dependencies.
  - Example: `sudo apt install package_name`

- **Updating Packages**: Keep software up-to-date with commands like `apt update` and `apt upgrade`.

- **Removing Packages**: Uninstall software to free up space and manage system resources.
  - Example: `sudo apt remove package_name`

## Repositories and PPAs ðŸ“š

- **Repositories**: Collections of software packages, maintained by distributions or third parties.

- **PPAs (Personal Package Archives)**: Ubuntu-specific repositories that provide additional software not included in the default distribution.

### Examples
```bash
# Install a package using apt
sudo apt install package_name

# Update package lists and upgrade installed packages
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade

# Remove a package using apt
sudo apt remove package_name
```

### Summary

Package management in Linux involves using specific package managers like `apt`, `yum`, `dnf`, and `pacman` to install, update, and remove software packages. Repositories provide access to software collections, while PPAs (on Ubuntu) offer additional software not found in default repositories. Understanding these tools is essential for managing software installations and updates efficiently on Linux distributions.
