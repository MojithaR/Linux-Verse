# Process Management

## Understanding Processes üîÑ

| Command     | Description                                       |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `ps`        | Displays information about processes.              |
| `top`       | Interactive process viewer, provides dynamic view. |
| `htop`      | Interactive process viewer (improved `top`).      |

## Managing Processes üõ†Ô∏è

| Command     | Description                                       |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `kill`      | Terminates a process by ID or name.               |
| `bg`        | Puts a process in the background.                 |
| `fg`        | Brings a background process to the foreground.    |

## Scheduling Processes ‚è∞

| Command     | Description                                       |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `cron`      | Scheduler that runs commands at specified times.  |
| `at`        | Executes commands at a specified time once.       |

### Examples
```bash
# Kill a process by ID
kill PID

# Put a process in the background
bg

# Bring a background process to the foreground
fg

# Schedule a task using cron
crontab -e

# Schedule a task using at
at now + 1 hour
```

### Summary

Process management in Linux involves understanding, managing, and scheduling processes efficiently. Commands like `ps`, `top`, and `htop` provide insights into running processes. Managing processes includes terminating (`kill`), backgrounding (`bg`), and foregrounding (`fg`). Scheduling tasks can be automated using `cron` for recurring jobs and `at` for one-time executions, enhancing system automation and efficiency.
